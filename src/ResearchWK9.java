/*
 * 
 *		Research 10 different datatypes used in MySQL and write how they are used and what makes them unique.
 *
 */
	
/*
 * 1)  VARCHAR()
 * 		This datatype holds a String that can be as long as the number of characters specified 
 * 		inside the parenthesis. This String is unique because it can be variable - or in other
 * 		words it can be any length between 0 and 255.
 * 
 * 2) CHAR()
 * 		This, much like varchar() is a String but the difference here is that the CHAR() holds
 * 		a fixed length String that is specified in the parenthesis - it can store up to 255 chars. 
 * 
 * 3,4,5,6) TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT
 * 		And at last - we have datatypes for long blocks/strings paragraphs of text, between TEXT
 * 		TINYTEXT, MEDIUMTEXT AND LONGTEXT we can use Strings with varying lengths which are: 
 * 		65,535 | 255 | 16,777,215 | and 4,294,967,295 respectively. Size makes those unique.
 * 		
 * 7) DATETIME()
 * 		An easy datatype that combines conveniently both the date and the time
 * 		The format for the different date and time datatypes are what make each unique. For this 
 * 		particular date/time datatype the format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
 * 
 * 8, 9, 10, 11) TINYINT(), SMALLINT(), MEDIUMINT(), INT(), BIGINT()
 * 		Like the TEXT datatypes - these are integer datatypes that also come uniquely in different
 * 		size packages for space and processing efficiency.
